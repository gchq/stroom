* Add BCrypt as a hashing algorithm to data feed keys. Change Data feed key auth to require the header as configured by `dataFeedKeyOwnerMetaKey`. Change `hashAlgorithmId` to `hashAlgorithm` in the data feed keys json file.


## [v7.9-beta.7] - 2025-04-07

* Issue **#4831** : Fix Data Retention -> Impact Summary not showing any data.

* Issue **#4829** : Fix stuck searches.

* Issue **#4830** : Use a cache rather than sessions to maintain auth flow state to avoid creating unnecessary sessions.

* Issue **#4842** : Fix null session when doing OIDC code flow with KeyCloak.

* Issue **#4844** : Fix issue where vis parent table filters are not applied to the right data values.

* Issue **#4837** : Change the fetching of OIDC config to use jersey client instead of Apache http client. The yaml properties `appConfig.security.authentication.openId.httpClient` and `proxyConfig.security.authentication.openId.httpClient` have been removed. Configuration of the jersey client is now done using `jerseyClients.OPEN_ID.` (see https://gchq.github.io/stroom-docs/docs/install-guide/configuration/stroom-and-proxy/common-configuration/#jersey-http-client-configuration).

* Issue **#4849** : Fix the default forwarding queue config so that it retries for HTTP and not for FILE. Add the config prop `queue.queueAndRetryEnabled` to control whether forwarding is queued with retry handling or not. Add the config prop `atomicMoveEnabled` to `forwardFileDestinations` items to allow disabling of atomic file moves when using a remote file system that doesn't support atomic moves.


## [v7.9-beta.6] - 2025-04-07

* Issue **#4109** : Add `receive` config properties `x509CertificateHeader`, `x509CertificateDnHeader` and `allowedCertificateProviders` to control the use of certificates and DNs placed in the request headers by load balancers or reverse proxies that are doing the TLS termination. Header keys were previously hard coded. `allowedCertificateProviders` is an allow list of FQDN/IPs that are allowed to use the cert/DN headers.

* Add Dropwizard Metrics to proxy.

* Change proxy to use the same caching as stroom.

* Remove unused proxy config property `maxAggregateAge`. `aggregationFrequency` controls the aggregation age/frequency.

* Stroom-Proxy instances that are making remote feed status requests using an API key or token, will now need to hold the application permission `Check Receipt Status` in Stroom. This prevents anybody with an API key from checking feed statuses.

* Issue **#4312** : Add Data Feed Keys to proxy and stroom to allow their use in data receipt authentication. Replace `proxyConfig.receive.(certificateAuthenticationEnabled|tokenAuthenticationEnabled)` with `proxyConfig.receive.enabledAuthenticationTypes` that takes values: `DATA_FEED_KEY|TOKEN|CERTIFICATE` (where `TOKEN` means an oauth token or an API key). The feed status check endpoint `/api/feedStatus/v1` has been deprecated. Proxies with a version >=v7.9 should now use `/api/feedStatus/v2`.

* Replace proxy config prop `proxyConfig.eventStore.maxOpenFiles` with `proxyConfig.eventStore.openFilesCache`.

* Add optional auto-generation of the `Feed` attribute using property `proxyConfig.receive.feedNameGenerationEnabled`. This is used alongside properties `proxyConfig.receive.feedNameTemplate` (which defines a template for the auto-generated feed name using meta keys and their values) and `feedNameGenerationMandatoryHeaders` which defines the mandatory meta headers that must be present for a auto-generation of the feed name to be possible.

* Add a new _Content Templates_ screen to stroom (requires `Manage Content Templates` application permission). This screen is used to define rules for matching incoming data where the feed does not exist and creating content to process data for that feed.

* Feed status check calls made by a proxy into stroom now require the application permission `Check Receipt Status`. This is to stop anyone with an API key from discovering the feeds available in stroom. Any existing API keys used for feed status checks on proxy will need to have `Check Receipt Status` granted to the owner of the key.

* Issue **#4844** : Fix issue where vis parent table filters are not applied to the right data values.


## [v7.9-beta.5] - 2025-04-02

* Issue **#4831** : Fix Data Retention -> Impact Summary not showing any data.

* Issue **#4829** : Fix stuck searches.

* Issue **#4830** : Use a cache rather than sessions to maintain auth flow state to avoid creating unnecessary sessions.

* Issue **#4839** : Change record count filter to allow counting of records at a custom depth to match split filter.

* Issue **#4842** : Fix null session when doing OIDC code flow with KeyCloak.


## [v7.9-beta.4] - 2025-03-25

* Issue **#4828** : Fix recursive cache invalidation for index load.

* Issue **#4827** : Fix NPE when opening the Nodes screen.


## [v7.9-beta.3] - 2025-03-24

* Issue **#4733** : Fix report shutdown error.

* Issue **#4700** : Add props `forwardFileDestinations.subPathTemplate`,  `forwardFileDestinations.templatingMode` and `forwardHttpDestinations.errorSubPathTemplate` to allow templating of the file destination paths. Change the default retries to infinite. Make the following Stroom status codes go straight to the HTTP forwarder error destination: FEED_IS_NOT_DEFINED(101), FEED_IS_NOT_SET_TO_RECEIVE_DATA(110), UNEXPECTED_DATA_TYPE(120). Make the `data` directory more permissive to invalid files/directories that it finds. Remove the retry config prop `maxRetries` and replace it with `maxRetryAge` and `retryDelayGrowthFactor` to allow for a retry delay that grows with each retry. Change the file forwarder to support queueing/retry for remote file systems. Move the queue/retry config into the `queue` branch of the destination config. Fix issue of missing `.entries` files when rebooting proxy. Change the `thread` branch of the config, previous properties moved into `queue`, new properties added to control aggregation.

Added the property `stroom.ui.maxEditorCompletionEntries` to control the maximum number of completions items that are shown. In the event that the property is exceeded, Stroom will pre-filter the completions based on the user's input.

* Add Visualisations to the Query help and editor completions. Visualisation completion inserts a snippet containing all the data fields in the Visualisation, e.g. `TextValue(field = Field, gridSeries = Grid Series)`.

* Issue **#4436** : Change the way API Keys are verified. Stroom now finds all valid api keys matching the api key prefix and compares the hash of the api key against the hash from each of the matching records. Support has also been added for using different hash algorithms.

* Issue **#4379** : Improve Stroom permission model.


## [v7.5-beta.9] - 2024-08-30

* Issue **#4383** : Add an authentication error screen to be shown when a user tries to login and there is an authentication problem or the user's account has been locked/disabled. Previously the user was re-directed to the sign-in screen even if cert auth was enabled.

* Issue **#4395** : Fix ClassCastException when using a stepping xpath filter that returns something other than a list of nodes, e.g. a double, long, boolean, etc.. This means you can now do something like `/Events/Event/Meta/sm:source/sm:recordNo > 2` `equals` `true`, or `/Events/Event/Meta/sm:source/sm:recordNo mod 2` `equals` `0`.

* Issue **#3960** : Migrate to Elasticsearch Java API Client.

* Add _Next Scheduled_ column to the detail pane of the Job screen.

* Add _Build Version_ and _Up Date_ columns to the Nodes screen. Also change the styling of the _Ping_ column so an enabled node with no ping stands out while a disabled node does not. Also change the row styling for disabled nodes.

* Add a Run now icon to the jobs screen to execute a job on a node immediately.

* Change the FS Volume and Index Volume tables to low-light CLOSED/INACTIVE volumes. Add tooltips to the path and last updated columns. Change the _Use%_ column to a percentage bar. Add red/green colouring to the _Full_ column values.

* Issue **#4348** : Fix error with `IN DICTIONARY` term in rule when the dictionary is empty/blank.

* Issue **#4305** : Don't show warnings on the Server Tasks screen for disabled nodes. Append `(Disabled)` to the node name for disabled nodes in case a disabled node is still running tasks. Changed the position of the warning icon to the right of the wrap icon so it is the right-most icon.

* Make the expand/collapse all icons on Server Tasks and Data Retention Impact Summary consistent with those on the Explorer tree.

* Add properties `httpHeadersStreamMetaDataAllowList` and `httpHeadersStreamMetaDataDenyList` to `HttpAppender` to allow fine grained control of what stream meta keys are sent to the HTTP destination as HTTP headers and `.meta` entries.

* Change `/datafeed` receipt to always set `ReceivedTime` to `now()`. If it was already set (e.g. by proxy) then that value is added to `ReceivedTimeHistory` along with the latest `ReceivedTime`. This can be used to see the latency between proxy receipt and stroom receipt. This is similar to how `ReceivedPath` works.

* Make long descriptions on the Edit Property (pipeline element property) screen wrap onto multiple lines.

* Issue **#4317** : Fix explicit `Feed` header being ignored when `compression` is `true` on `HttpAppender`.

* Issue **#4331** : Fix `java.lang.IllegalStateException` errors when using HTTPAppender.

* Issue **#4330** : Fix NPE in HTTPAppender when the destination errors.

* Improve description text for HttpAppender properties. Also add validation of some property values.

* Add property `useContentEncodingHeader` to HttpAppender to allow the user to choose between using the stroom bespoke `Compression` and HTTP standard `Content-Encoding` headers.

* When using zip compression with HttpAppender, make the .meta file also respect the various HTTP header pipeline element properties.


## [v7.5-beta.4] - 2024-06-28

* Issue **#4339** : Allow user selection of analytic duplicate columns.


## [v7.5-beta.3] - 2024-06-27

* Issue **#2126** : Add experimental state store.

* Issue **#4305** : Don't show warnings on the Server Tasks screen for disabled nodes. Append `(Disabled)` to the node name for disabled nodes in case a disabled node is still running tasks. Changed the position of the warning icon to the right of the wrap icon so it is the right-most icon.

* Make the expand/collapse all icons on Server Tasks and Data Retention Impact Summary consistent with those on the Explorer tree.

* Issue **#4334** : Popup explorer text on mouse hover.


## [v7.5-beta.2] - 2024-06-17

* Issue **#4278** : Make document deletion also delete the permission records for that document. Also run migration `V07_04_00_005__Orphaned_Doc_Perms` which will delete all document permissions (in table `doc_permission`) for docs that are not a folder, not the System doc, are not a valid doc (i.e. in the `doc` table) and are not a pipeline filter. Deleted document permission records will first be copied to a backup table `doc_permission_backup_V07_04_00_005`. 

* Change document Copy and Move to check that the user has Owner permission (or admin) on the document being copied/moved if the permissions mode is None, Destination or Combined. This is because those modes will change the permissions which is something only an Owner/admin can do.

* Fix verification of the `signer` key in the JWS headers when authentication is handled by an AWS load balancer. If you use AWS load balancers for authentication you must add the partial ARN(s) of your load balancer(s) to the property `stroom.security.authentication.openId.expectedSignerPrefixes`.

Previously content was imported as the 'admin' user, but this user may not exist in all environments. Setting of the user/group is done with the following config properties `stroom.contentPackImport.importAsSubjectId` (the unique identifier for the user/group) and `stroom.contentPackImport.importAsType` (`USER` or `GROUP`).

* Issue **#3749** : Replace Stroom simple cron scheduler with standard compliant Quartz cron scheduler.

* Issue **#4041** : Improve date picker.

* Issue **#4131** : Make Stroom's standard date parsing more lenient to accept various forms of ISO 8601 zoned date times, e.g. with varying number of fractional second digits, no fractional seconds, no seconds, different offset forms ('+02', '+0200', '+02:00', etc.). Normalise `EffectiveTime` and `ReceivedTime` header values so the dates are in Stroom's standard format.


## [v7.3-beta.11] - 2024-03-01

* Issue **#4132** : Add tooltips to the copy/open hover buttons on table cell values.

* Issue **#4018** : Change the way delimited meta values are held internally. They are now comma delimited internally and when written to file.

* Issue **#3971** : Allow use of date expressions with `filter` keyword.

* Issue **#4090** : Fix JSON error location reporting.


## [v7.3-beta.8] - 2024-02-17

* Issue **#4030** : Fix token validation for date expressions.

* Issue **#3991** : Add close button to query text window.

* Issue **#3337** : Improve find content feature to highlight the matches in found docs.

* Issue **#4059** : Fix stream browser not showing any streams.

* Issue **#3993** : Add recent items popup and find popup.

* Issue **#1753** : Add expand all explorer option.

* Issue **#4082** : Add XSLT function hex-to-string(hex, charsetName).

* Issue **#4085** : Fix value in error message when the ref data reference count overflows.

* Issue **#4084** : Fix double shift behaviour to show `find`.

* Issue **#4088** : Add links and copy capability to meta browser.

* Issue **#3966** : Add detailed task information for task fetching process.

* Issue **#4092** : Fix explorer expand behaviour.

* Issue **#4094** : Fix change behaviour of entity selection popup.

* Add support for `<xsl:message>some message</xsl:message>` which will log the message as `ERROR`, which is consistent with the `stroom:log()` function. If the attribute `terminate="yes"` is set, the it will log as `FATAL`, which will stop processing. You can also use a suitably named child element to set the severity, `<xsl:message><info>my message</info></xsl:message>`. Use of `terminate="yes"` trumps any severity set. Previous behaviour was to log to `stdout` and throw an exception if `terminate` is `yes`.

* Issue **#4096** : Improve wrapped table data CSS.

* Issue **#4097** : Fix Meta filter giving 'unknown field' error for fields like 'Raw Size'.

* Issue **#4101** : Expand favourites by default.

* Issue **#4091** : Fix Number column format for duration and date values. Now shows the duration in millis and millis since unix epoch respectively. Also fix lack of rounding when setting a fixed number of decimal places.

* Stop 'ADD TASKS TO QUEUE' from spamming the logs when there are no tasks to queue, i.e. a quiet system.

* Change `<xsl:message terminate="yes">` to halt processing of the current stream part immediately, in addition to logging a FATAL error. This is different from the `stroom:log('FATAL'...)` call that will log a _FATAL_ error but won't halt processing.

* Add a XML editor snippet for adding an `<xsl:element>` block with the alias `elem`.

* Issue **#4104** : Fix open document direct links.

* Issue **#4033** : Fix an infinite loop when stepping raw JSON with a FindReplaceFilter. Change the way character data is decoded in the stepper so that it is more lenient to un-decodable bytes, replacing them with '�'. Also make the reader code in the stepper respond to task termination. Add stepper error for each byte sequence that can't be decoded.

* Fix missing fatal/error/warn/info gutter icons in the Ace editor.

* Change stepper so that errors/warn/etc. with no line/col location are not included in the coloured indicator at the top right of the pane. Location agnostic errors now only feature in the log pane at the bottom.

* Change the stepper log pane so that it only provides location/pane information if the location is known. The code has been changed to allow the server to explicitly state which pane an error relates to or if it is not specific to a pane. Elements with no code pane, now default errors with location information to belonging to the Input pane rather than the Output pane as previously.

* Issue **#4054** : Fix comparison of double values, e.g. `toDouble(20000) > toDouble(125000000)`. Improve comparison/sorting logic to cope with the new Duration type and to better handle mixed type comparison.

* Issue **#4056** : Fix display value of Error type values in query/dashboard. Now shows error message prefixed with `ERR: `.

* Issue **#4055** : Fix parsing/formatting of durations in query/dashboard expressions.

* Issue **#3951** : Add term copy feature to stream filters.

* Issue **#4052** : Fix query helper breadcrumbs.

* Issue **#4049** : Fix term editor field selection.

* Issue **#4024** : Fix concurrency issues in CompleteableQueue that were causing searches to get stuck. Also fix similar issues in StreamEventMap.

* Issue **#3900** : Fix bug when using an expression term like `Last Commit > 2023-12-22T11:19:32.000Z` when searching the Index Shards data source.


## [v7.3-beta.6] - 2024-01-22

* Issue **#3975** : Add `cidr-to-numeric-ip-range` XSLT function.

* Issue **#4010** : Change ERROR logging to DEBUG when search requests cannot be created, e.g. when a rule has a blank or invalid query string.

* Issue **#4007** : Change the Lucene search code so that it will use the Index's default extraction pipeline if there is no extraction set on the dashboard, or in the case of StroomQL, always use the Index's default extraction pipeline as there no way to set a pipeline.

* Issue **#4021** : Fix using the `parseDuration(...)` function inside another function, e.g. `max(parseDuration(...))`.

* Issue **#4019** : Fix inability to change a date term in a filter tree. Change expression tree validation to use server-side validation so it can validate date terms correctly.

* Issue **#4029** : Change the `/api/(query|dashboard)/v1/(search|downloadSearcResults)` to accept a null `nodeName` path param, e.g. `/api/query/v1/search`.


## [v7.3-beta.5] - 2024-01-19

* Issue **#3915** : Change how multi-line attribute values (e.g. for `Files`) are written to the .meta/.mf files. Previously they were written as is so resulted in multiple lines in the file for one entry, which breaks parsing of the file. Now multi-line values are comma delimited in the file, so each entry will be on a single line. Existing meta/mf files in the system cannot be changed.

* Issue **#3981** : Fix processor records being created with the wrong pipeline UUID.

* Issue **#3979** : Fix term editor condition losing selection.

* Issue **#3979** : Fix term editor condition losing selection.

* Issue **#3891** : Add support for `not equals` `!=` term condition.

* Issue **#4014** : Fix queries hanging dur to an infinite loop when using `countGroups()` expression function.

* Change SQL migration `V07_02_00_110__api_key_legacy_data_migration.sql` to include all API keys, not just enabled ones.

* Issue **#4012** : Fix NPE when cascading perms on a folder with no current perms.

* Change V07_02_00_110__api_key_legacy_data_migration.sql to make prefix column values unique.

* Fix duplicate entries in selection boxes.

* Fix broken SQL migration script V07_02_00_110__api_key_legacy_data_migration.sql.

* Issue **#3952** : Fix handling of thread interrupts (e.g. when a ref load is triggered by a search extraction and the search is stopped) during reference data loads. Interrupted ref loads now correctly get a load state of TERMINATED. Stopped searches no longer show a warning triangle with ref errors. Terminated pipeline tasks no longer list errors/warnings for the ref load/lookups.

* Issue **#3937** : Re-work the API keys screen using GWT rather than React. Change the structure of the API keys from a JSON Web Token to a 'dumb' random string. Add the ability to enable/disable tokens. Change Stroom to store the hash of the API key rather than the key itself. Include a prefix in the API key (which is stored in Stroom) so that users can identify a key they have against the list of keys in Stroom. Legacy API Keys that are _enabled_ will be migrated from the `token` table into the new `apk-key` table. This is mostly so there is visibility of the legacy API keys. As the legacy API keys are JWTs and Stroom was not checking the `token` table for their presence, authentication relies on the JWT being valid and not expired. It is recommended to create new API keys and get users of the legacy API keys to migrate over. The new API keys allow temporary/permanent revocation so are more secure.

* Issue **#3987** : Fix duration functions by replacing `duration()` with `parseDuration()`, `parseISODuration()`, `formatDuration()` and `formatISODuration()`.

* Issue **#4004** : Remove dynamic tag from extraction pipeline selection for Views.

* Issue **#3990** : Fix refresh of explorer tree on delete of a document/folder.

* Issue **#3964** : Add XSLT function for testing whether an IP address is within the specified CIDR range.

* Issue **#3982** : Fix text colour in step filter element selector.

* Issue **#3983** : Fix colour of hamburger menu in light theme so it is visible.

* Issue **#3984** : Text editor fixed line height is now more appropriate for each font size.

* Issue **#3985** : Fix dashboard table custom date format checkbox state.

* Issue **#3950** : Rules now work with non-dynamic indexes.

* Issue **#4002** : Fix setting dirty state when switching to notification tab on rules.

* Issue **#4001** : Fix pipeline structure editor element drag issue.

* Issue **#3999** : Main pane scroll bar now displays where needed.

* Add the un-authenticated API method `/api/authproxy/v1/noauth/fetchClientCredsToken` to effectively proxy for the IDP's token endpoint to obtain an access token using the client credentials flow. The request contains the client credentials and looks like `{ "clientId": "a-client", "clientSecret": "BR9m.....KNQO" }`. The response media type is `text/plain` and contains the access token.

* Change processing user token expiry time from 1year to 10min when using internal identity provider.

* Remove the CLI command `fetch_proc_user_token` as it is now replaced by the `/authproxy/v1/noauth` API method.

* Fix issues with the refreshing of expired authentication tokens. Change the age of the service user token from 1yr to 10mins for the internal IDP.

* Issue **#3947** : Fix owner validation of document permissions when cascading permissions. Now the validation requiring a single owner is only applied to the top level document being edited. Descendant documents may have no owners or multiple owners due to legacy behaviour in stroom. If there is no change to the owner of the top level document then the descendant owners will be ignored. If _Cascade_ is set to _All_ or there is a change to the owner of the top level document and _Cascade_ is set to _Changes Only_ then the top level owner will be made the only owner of all descendants replacing any existing owners. This change also adds a confirmation dialog that shows what changes will be made to descendant documents. See the GitHub issue for examples.

* Issue **#3956** : Fix SearchRequestBuilder reuse.

* Add minor performance optimisation to the byte buffer pool used by the reference data store.

* Issue **#3953** : Fix search buffer size issue.

* Issue **#3948** : Add `and` and `or` functions.

* Issue **#3956** : Add debug to diagnose expression parsing issue.

* Issue **#3913** : Change zip data handling so unknown file extensions are treated as part of the base name, e.g. `001.unknown` gets a base name of `001.unknown` (unless we see a known extension like `001.ctx` in which case `001.unknown` gets a base name of `001`), `abc.xyz.10001` gets a base name of `abc.xyz.10001`.

* Issue **#3945** : Fix light theme colours.

* Issue **#3942** : Fix user identity in audit logging.

* Issue **#3939** : Fix issue changing editor them in user preferences.

* Issue **#3938** : Fix `lockInterruptibly` on `CompletableQueue`.
