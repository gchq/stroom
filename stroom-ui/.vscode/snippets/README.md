Place your snippets for javascript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
$1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
same ids are connected.
Example:
"Print to console": {
"prefix": "log",
"body": [
"console.log('$1');",
"$2"
],
"description": "Log output to console"
}
