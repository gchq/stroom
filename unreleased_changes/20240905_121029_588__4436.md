* Issue **#4436** : Change the way API Keys are verified. Stroom now finds all valid api keys matching the api key prefix and compares the hash of the api key against the hash from each of the matching records. Support has also been added for using different hash algorithms.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Change API key verification to also verify the key prefix 
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4436
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
