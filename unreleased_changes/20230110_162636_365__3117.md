* Issue **#3117** : Add _Preferred Username_ and _Full name_ to the user permissions data grids when using an external IDP. This is to make it easier to identify which users are which when assigning permissions as the IDP unique identity may be a UUID.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Show additional user info in User Perms screen when using 3rd party IDP
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3117
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
