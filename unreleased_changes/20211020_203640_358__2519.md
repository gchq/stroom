* Issue **#2519** : Added validation for processor filter expressions and more info about filters to the UI.


```bash
# Only the top line will be included in the CHANGELOG.
# Entries should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a single
# line with no hard breaks.
#
# Examples of accptable entires are:
#
#
# * Issue **1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * A change with no associated GitHub issue.
```
