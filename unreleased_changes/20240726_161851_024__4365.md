* Issue **#4365** : Change stroomQL to be case-insensitive in terms of fields, eval variables, data source names, visualisation names, visualisation param names. Change the way stroom works with fields from index providers (e.g. Lucene, Elastic, etc.) so that stroom ignores case unless it finds multiple matching field names in which case it will try a case-sensitive match. If there is no case-sensitive match in this scenario then the query will error.



```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: StroomQL is accepting case-insensitive Field names
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4365
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
