/**
 * A completion proposed by an {@link AceCompletionProvider}. This particular implementation
 * allows for tabstops to be defines post-sunstitution.<br><br>This is useful when providing substitutions with
 * a default value in the centre of the substituted text value that typically has to be overwritten by the user or
 * when substituting several values that should be modified by the user.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * There are two different constructors, a simple constructor that trust the user to manually escape the snippet text, and
 * a constructor where the escaping and tokenization is managed.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning</strong>: this is an experimental feature of AceGWT.
 * It is possible that the API will change in an incompatible way
