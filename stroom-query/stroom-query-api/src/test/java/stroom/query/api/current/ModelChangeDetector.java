/**
 * If a model is part of an API it should often not be changed without re-versioning, - otherwise
 * anything that depends on it could fail. But it is easy, in the heat of a big change, to forget one has
 * changed a model. This test is meant to catch these cases and alert the developer.
 * <p>
 * After being alerted of the model change a developer will probably want to follow some model-change process.
 * After doing that the test that fails here could be resolved by temporarily uncommenting the line in the
 * test that writes out the model's portrait. Don't commit this test with the line uncommented! If you do the
 * test will always pass.
