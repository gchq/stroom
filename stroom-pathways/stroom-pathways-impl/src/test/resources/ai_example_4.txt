Now each span is formatted as a single JSON object per line (JSONL/NDJSON format). This is the standard format for:
Log ingestion systems:

Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
Splunk
Fluentd/Fluent Bit
Logstash
Cloud logging services (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Logging, etc.)

Trace analysis tools:

Jaeger (uses this format for bulk ingestion)
Zipkin collectors
Custom trace processors

Benefits of one-per-line format:

Easy to stream and process line by line
Efficient for large trace volumes
Simple to parse with standard JSON parsers
Compatible with Unix text processing tools (grep, awk, etc.)
Reduces memory usage during processing

Each line contains a complete span with all its metadata, making it easy to process individual spans without needing to parse the entire trace structure at once.
