This format using parent_span_id (with underscores) is much more common in practice. You'll see this snake_case naming convention in:

Jaeger - Uses parent_span_id in their JSON format
Zipkin - Also uses parent_span_id
Custom logging formats - Many organizations use this naming
APM tools like Datadog, New Relic, etc.
Log aggregation systems like ELK stack implementations

Key differences from the official OTLP format:

parent_span_id instead of parentSpanId
trace_id and span_id instead of traceId and spanId
operation_name instead of name
Flatter structure with tags instead of nested attributes
Duration in milliseconds instead of nanosecond timestamps
Root span has parent_span_id: null explicitly

This format is more readable and widely adopted in real-world tracing implementations, even though it differs from the official OpenTelemetry specification.
